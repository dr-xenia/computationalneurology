I am an assistant professor (tenure track) in Neurostimulation at Ruhr University Bochum (faculty of medicine). I am an expert in neurodegenerative diseases and brain modelling and affiliated with several leading brain research institutions, such as [UPF’s computational neuroscience lab](https://www.upf.edu/web/cns) and the [German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)](https://www.dzne.de/en/).

Being a neurologist and a neuroscientist, I truly identify as a translational neuroscientist. On the one hand, translation means that I take problems that are brought up by clinical practitioners in the hospital and translate them into research questions. On the other hand, translation also means that I take the answers that have been identified in my lab and translate them back to the clinic, so that our research results contribute to improving patients’ lives.

I am a strong believer in freedom of information in research and strive to bring principles of open science to the clinical research community (making research more reproducible, robust, and inclusive). Furthermore, I am also interested in the digital transformation of healthcare and how to use medical informatics tools that is beneficial for patients and health-care workers.

To get acquainted with my individual research contributions, please see the [publications page](/publications/) and visit my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tlMCbgwAAAAJ).

A non-technical description of my group’s research, addressed to a non-expert audience, is availabe at the [non-expert information page](/non-expert-info/) and information for German patients can be found at the [Patienten-Informations-Seite (in German language)](/patienten-info/).
