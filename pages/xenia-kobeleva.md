    <p>I am an assistant professor (tenure track) in Neurostimulation at Ruhr University Bochum (faculty of medicine). I am an expert in neurodegenerative diseases and brain modelling and affiliated with several leading brain research institutions, such as <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/cns">UPF’s computational neuroscience lab</a> and the <a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/">German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)</a>.</p>
    <p>Being a neurologist and a neuroscientist, I truly identify as a translational neuroscientist. On the one hand, translation means that I take problems that are brought up by clinical practitioners in the hospital and translate them into research questions. On the other hand, translation also means that I take the answers that have been identified in my lab and translate them back to the clinic, so that our research results contribute to improving patients’ lives.</p>
    <p>I am a strong believer in freedom of information in research and strive to bring principles of open science to the clinical research community (making research more reproducible, robust, and inclusive). Furthermore, I am also interested in the digital transformation of healthcare and how to use medical informatics tools that is beneficial for patients and health-care workers.</p>
