		<h2 style="margin:0px;">Prof. Dr. Xenia Kobeleva</h2>
		<p>Research Group Leader</p>
		<p>Xenia Kobeelva an assistant professor (tenure track) in Neurostimulation at Ruhr University Bochum (faculty of medicine). She is an expert in neurodegenerative diseases and brain modelling and affiliated with several leading brain research institutions, such as UPF’s computational neuroscience lab and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). As a physician by training, she identifies as a translational neuroscientist, attaining research questions from the bedside, studying them in the lab, and bringing solutions back to the bedside.</p>

		<p>PhD Candidate</p>
		<p>Riccardo Leone obtained his Medical Degree (2016) and his Certificate of Specialization in Radiology (2022) from San Raffaele University in Milan, Italy. Since September 2022, he is a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the Computational Neurology Research Group.</p>
		<p>In his research, Riccardo Leone focuses on building whole-brain models of brain functional activity in patients along the dementia spectrum. By incorporating biological observables (e.g., vascular pathology) in these models, he seeks to develop deterministic explanations of how these pathophysiological processes lead to cognitive impairment, and he also aims to develop reliable models that could be used for personalized simulation of treatments to improve patients’ treatment options.</p>

		<p>Postgraduate Research Assistant</p>
		<p>Steven Geysen studied Experimental Psychology at the University of Ghent. He is especially interested in the insights into human behavior that computational models can provide by explaining behavioral and neural data. As a research assistant at the Computational Neurology Research Group, he works on a project about cognitive reserve.</p>

		<p>Postgraduate Research Assistant</p>
		<p>Nahid Hasan is deeply interested in the exploration of human consciousness using the predictive processing framework and advanced brain imaging techniques. He holds a master’s degree in Neuroscience from the University of Bonn, where he conducted research on neural correlates of biological motion perception using fMRI and MVPA.</p>
		<p>Currently, as a research assistant in the Computational Neurology Research Group, his primary focus is on developing a Python pipeline for implementing whole-brain dynamical models and employing Bayesian methods to estimate model parameters. Starting from September 2023, he will be transitioning to the Department of Systemic Neurosciences at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) as a PhD student.</p>
