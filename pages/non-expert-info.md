<ul>
   <li>As translational researchers, we focus on bringing scientific discoveries back to the patients and also receive research ideas from our clinical work.</li>
   <li>We dedicate ourselves to the research and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</li>
   <li>These are diseases in which neurons progressively lose their function and die.</li>
   <li>Typical representatives of these diseases are Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease.</li>
   <li>We evaluate biomarkers; these are tools that allow us to detect these diseases earlier (which is necessary in order to apply preventions and early therapies).</li>
   <li>Furthermore, we are interested in bringing digitalization into the medical world in a way that is best for patients and healthcare workers.</li>
