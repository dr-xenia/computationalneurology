As translational researchers, we focus on bringing scientific discoveries back to the patients and also receive research ideas from our clinical work. We dedicate ourselves to the research and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. These are diseases in which neurons progressively lose their function and die. Typical representatives of these diseases are <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="https://www.als.org/understanding-als/what-is-als">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</a>, and <a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons">Parkinson's disease</a>. We evaluate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078627/">biomarkers</a>; these are tools that allow us to detect these diseases earlier (which is necessary in order to apply preventions and early therapies). Furthermore, we are interested in bringing digitalization into the medical world in a way that is best for patients and healthcare workers.
