<b>Students</b>

<p>We welcome students who are interested in experimental and theoretical analyses of pathological oscillations in neurodegeneration and their modulation with neurostimulation, as well as explorations of dynamical models and model fitting.</p>

<p>You may join us for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>master's theses,</li>
		<li>doctoral theses,</li>
		<li>and internships.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Due to the group's interdisciplinary orientation, we are open to students from different fields:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Medicine,</li>
		<li>Computer Science,</li>
		<li>Physics,</li>
		<li>Mathematics,</li>
		<li>Neurosciene,</li>
		<li>and related fields.</li>
	</ul>
<p>If you are interested, you can apply via e-mail (mail -ατ- computationalneurology.com) with your CV and a short statement of motivation.</p>

<b>Currently available master theses</b><p>
<u>Explore dynamical consequences of neurostimulation using neural mass modeling</u><p>
Personalization of neurostimulation can improve its efficacy whilst taking into account the increasing complexity of the corresponding technology and the amount of technical choices (regarding stimulation location and stimulation settings). In this project we aim to create a whole-brain neural mass model that can accurately predict the effect of different neurostimulation settings in healthy and neurologically impaired individuals. 

<p>If you are interested, please apply via e-mail (mail -ατ- computationalneurology.com) with your CV and a short statement of motivation.</p>
