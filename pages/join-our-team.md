<b>Students</b>

<p>We welcome students who are interested in experimental and theoretical analyses of pathological oscillations in neurodegeneration and their modulation with neurostimulation, as well as explorations of dynamical models and model fitting.</p>

<p>You may join us for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>master's theses,</li>
		<li>doctoral theses,</li>
		<li>and internships.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Due to the group's interdisciplinary orientation, we are open to students from different fields:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Medicine,</li>
		<li>Computer Science,</li>
		<li>Physics,</li>
		<li>Mathematics,</li>
		<li>Neurosciene,</li>
		<li>and related fields.</li>
	</ul>
<p>We currently offer thesis supervision of students located at Ruhr University Bochum, TU Dortmund (Data Science) and University of Bonn. Students from other universities should gather information about the formalities of executing their thesis at another location. For student projects, we are open for students from all universities. If you are interested, you can apply via e-mail (mail -ατ- computationalneurology.com) with your CV and a short statement of motivation.</p>
